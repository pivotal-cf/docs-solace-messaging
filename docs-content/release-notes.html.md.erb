Release Notes for Solace PubSub+ for Pivotal Platform.

### v2.6.0

**Release Date: August 31, 2019**

This release of Solace PubSub+ for PCF tile contains Solace PubSub+ message broker v9.2.0.14 and introduces the following new features:

* Operators can now allocate ranges of IP addresses to pre-provisioned plans (ref # SOL-21624)

* Content was added to the Installation and Troubleshooting pages to document that all services in a Shared broker must be marked for upgrade before the upgrade can happen (ref # SOL-25053)


### v2.5.1

**Release Date: August 16, 2019**

This release of Solace PubSub+ for Pivotal Platform tile contains Solace PubSub+ message broker v9.2.0.14 and introduces the following new features:

* Authentication using OAuth is now provided (ref # SOL-20012)
* The number of on-demand service instances that can be upgraded at once is now configurable. This allows several services to be upgraded in parallel (reference # SOL-19582.)
* The Service Plan configuration forms now have fields for Cost, Currency and Pricing Unit (reference # SOL-20467.)
* The Service Instance Dashboard now provides more information about the service including the deployment provider, service creation parameters, plan name, VPN name, and IP address(es) (reference # 18553.)
* Support for BOSH DNS Aliases. Operators now have three options for the type of addresses to include in service binding credentials:
  * Include IP addresses (previously supported)
  * Include internal domain name (using *.solace.service.internal)
  * Include custom domain name (operator configurable, E.g. *.my-business.com)
  * Operators can use the third option combined with a public certificate authority to perform client certificate authentication.
* Support an option for the operator to configure a read-only PubSub+ management user which is automatically created on new service deployments. This user can be used by systems that monitor the health of the PubSub+ brokers.
* Support upgrading service instances from standalone to high availability services.
* Adds support for Shared Services, which means that one PubSub+ service instance can be accessed and shared across multiple Pivotal Platform orgs and spaces, so that the applications in different orgs/spaces can share the same messaging service.
* Adds support for Pivotal Platform v2.5.x and v2.6.x

In addition to the above features, this release resolves the following issues:

* LDAP configuration failed when the search filter was surrounded by single quotes (reference # SOL-19869.)
* The Service Dashboard showed an error after deleting service instances (reference # SOL-21989.)
* Fixed placement rules so that the solace-bosh-dns-aliases addon is deployed on the diego_cell instance groups (reference # SOL-20997.)
* The Cloud Foundry CLI has been upgraded to version 6.45.0 to fix a security vulnerability identified by Pivotal (reference # SOL-21267.)
* More detail was added to the Web Hook section on the Installation page of this documentation to highlight the requirements of REST endpoint status codes.
* A minimum disk size of 32768 for the standard-medium-ha plan ephemeral disk was incorrectly imposed (reference # SOL-18512.)
* Client-certificate authentication is enabled by default and is now globally configurable by operators (reference # SOL-17923.)
* A Solace PubSub+ service instance may still display the "Mark for upgrade" button after it has been upgraded (reference # SOL-17636.)
