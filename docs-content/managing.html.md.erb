Developers can manage the Message VPN associated with a service instance by using the Dashboard URL of the service and by connecting to the Solace PubSub+ message broker via the PubSub+ Manager web browser based interface.


## <a id='solace_pubsub_service_dashboard'></a> Solace PubSub+ Service Dashboard

The Solace PubSub+ Service Dashboard offers a link to the [Solace PubSub+ Manager](#solace_pubsub_manager) and the ability to capture a backup of basic service configuration and restore it.

### <a id='retrieve_dashboard'></a> Retrieve Dashboard Information

1. Look for the 'Dashboard' by getting details about the created service.

## <a id='solace_pubsub_configuration_backup_and_restore'></a> Solace PubSub+ Configuration Backup and Restore.

**Configuration Backup and Restore** is a **Beta** feature.

It offers the ability to capture a backup of service configuration and to restore it to the same or alternate service.

**A user is cautioned that the restore function can remove non matching contents on the restore target.**


## <a id='solace_pubsub_manager'></a> Solace PubSub+ Manager

The Solace PubSub+ message broker contains an early access version of the Solace PubSub+ Manager that offers a limited but growing set of Solace PubSub+ message broker management capabilities for the Solace PubSub+ services. This early access version is being released to provide customers with a view of our direction and to obtain early feedback on the look and feel of the Solace PubSub+ Manager. The Solace PubSub+ Manager does not yet have full management feature support for this GA version of the message broker, full support for the management of the message broker is available via SolAdmin and CLI. The Solace PubSub+ Manager is accessible when a service is created on a link in the [Solace PubSub+ Service Dashboard](#solace_pubsub_service_dashboard)

This section describes how to connect to the Solace PubSub+ message broker with the SolAdmin legacy administration tool to manage the Message VPN associated with a service instance.

### <a id='retrieve_bound_app'></a> Retrieve Information From a Bound App

To retrieve the information required to connect to the Solace PubSub+ message broker from a bound app, do the following:

1. Log in to your deployment and choose the org and space where your Solace PubSub+ service instance and bound app exists.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf login
  API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Email> user<span>@</span>example.com
  Password>
  </pre>

1. View the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable by retrieving the environment variables associated with your bound app:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf env YOUR-APP
  </pre>

### <a id='retrieve_service_key'></a> Retrieve Information from a Service Key

To retrieve the information required to connect to the Solace PubSub+ message broker from a service key, do the following:

1. Log in to your deployment and choose the org and space where your Solace PubSub+ service instance and service key exists.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf login
  API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Email> user<span>@</span>example.com
  Password>
  </pre>

1. View the service key:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf service-key solace-pubsub-instance my-service-key
  </pre>

### <a id='locate_credentials'></a> Locate the Management Host and Credentials

1. Both the `VCAP_SERVICES` and service key contain the same information, look for and record the following fields:
  * `managementHostnames`: The Solace PubSub+ message broker's management hostnames. There will be multiple entries for Services on HA Plans.
  * `activeManagementHostname`: A single entry that is dynamically routed to the active node for an HA service. Will always be the same as `managementHostnames` for non-HA plans.
  * When Management Access is set to `Message Broker Internal`:
      * `managementUsername`: The service instance's management username
      * `managementPassword`: The service instance's management password
  * When Management Access is set to `LDAP Server`:
      * The management username and password are to be provided by the LDAP Administrator.
  <br><br>
  For more information about the `VCAP_SERVICES` fields, see the [Understanding Credentials](credentials.html) topic.

### <a id='connect'></a> Connect to the Solace PubSub+ Message Broker

The `managementHostnames` and `activeManagementHostname` are externally accessible FQDNs and can be used directly from within SolAdmin using standard ports for HTTP (`80`) and HTTPS (`443`). The procedure is as follows:

1. Download and install the SolAdmin administration tool from the [Solace Developers Portal Download Page](http://dev.solace.com/downloads/).

1. Start SolAdmin.

1. Click **Manage** to open the **Manage Appliance** window.

1. Under **User Name** and **Password**, enter the management username and password recorded above.

1. Click **Ok**. The Solace PubSub+ message broker should now appear in the **Managed Appliances** list.
