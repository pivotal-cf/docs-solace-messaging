Solace PubSub+ for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) enables developers to take advantage of the leading multi-cloud, multi-protocol messaging solution which makes app interconnectivity easy and makes production apps scalable, robust, high-performant, and easy to manage.  

Solace PubSub+ was designed to be deployed across all your IT environments including your non-cloud datacenter, all leading public clouds ([AWS](http://dev.solace.com/clouds/amazon-web-services/), [Azure](http://dev.solace.com/clouds/azure/), and [Google Cloud Platform](http://dev.solace.com/clouds/google-cloud/)) and the popular Platform as a Service, PCF, in order to provide a uniform messaging fabric for all your apps and connect them no matter where they are deployed.

Solace PubSub+ supports all kinds of messaging APIs, QoS, and data streaming as part of one platform across all clouds in a high-performance, WAN-optimized, easy-to-manage solution. It is easily deployed in your public and private cloud environments and forms the perfect backbone for single or multi-cloud messaging support of your cloud-native micro-services, IoT, big data capture, and next-generation digital apps.

Solace PubSub+ for PCF provides plans for both shared message router instances for cost-effective development as well as a variety of plans for dedicated message routers of varying performance, scale, and high-availability. Together, they meet the requirements for a range of robust test and production deployments.

One of the key strengths of Solace PubSub+ is its [support for many different open transports and protocols](http://dev.solace.com/tech/#multi-service), making Solace PubSub+ Message Brokers ideal data distribution platforms to connect to any app.

## <a id='cloud-integration'></a>Cloud Integration 

A Solace PubSub+ deployment under PCF can be configured to support integration with existing cloud services and hybrid cloud deployments.

### <a id='pcf-solace-messaging-intergration-tcp_routes'></a>TCP Routes

TCP routes allow access to Solace messaging services hosted inside your PCF domain from external networks. By default, a PCF-hosted service is not accessible to external networks.

<%= image_tag('arch_tcp_routes.png') %>

Having TCP routes enables many use cases:

 * **Hybrid cloud:** Other Solace appliances or Solace PubSub+ Message Brokers deployed outside PCF can establish [Bridge](https://docs.solace.com/Features/Working-With-Message-VPN-Bridges.htm) connections to Solace PubSub+ services inside your PCF cloud. 
 * **External client app:** Apps deployed outside PCF can communicate via messaging with apps deployed inside PCF by connecting to a Solace PubSub+ service deployed in PCF.
 * **IoT:** Devices using MQTT or REST can connect to Solace PubSub+ services from outside PCF to communicate with your apps deployed inside PCF, look for the *TCP Routes for IoT---MQTT Java Application Tutorial* [Getting Started Samples](http://dev.solace.com/get-started/pcf-tutorials/) with full source code available in [GitHub](https://github.com/SolaceSamples/solace-samples-cloudfoundry-java/tcp-routes-mqtt/).
 * **Mobile apps:** Mobile and web apps can use [web messaging](https://docs.solace.com/Features/Web-Messaging-Concepts/Web-Messaging-Concepts.htm) to connect to Solace PubSub+ services from outside PCF to communicate with your apps deployed inside PCF.

To use TCP routes, you must [enable and configure TCP Routes at installation time](installing.html#optional_tcp_routes) with a selection of default settings for each messaging protocol you wish to use. Once enabled, TCP routes can be fine-tuned per service at service creation time.

### <a id='pcf-solace-messaging-intergration-system_logging'></a>System Logging

System logging allows you to redirect the logs from the Solace PubSub+ PCF components to an external syslog service. To use system logging, you must [enable and configure system logging at installation time](installing.html#optional_system_logging).

### <a id='pcf-solace-messaging-intergration-ldap'></a>LDAP

You can enable the use of an LDAP server for the Solace PubSub+ Message Broker's authentication and authorization needs.
This configuration allows you to grant an LDAP server control over Management access and Application access.
To use LDAP, you must [enable and configure LDAP at installation time](installing.html#optional_ldap_settings) and make a choice about [Management Access](installing.html#optional_management_access) and [Application Access](installing.html#optional_application_access).

## <a id='solace-messaging-features'></a>Solace PubSub+ Features
