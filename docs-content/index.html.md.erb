## <a id='cloud-integration'></a> Cloud Integration

A Solace PubSub+ deployment under VMware Tanzu can be configured to support integration with existing cloud services and hybrid cloud deployments.

### <a id='pcf-solace-messaging-intergration-tcp_routes'></a> TCP Routes

TCP routes allow access to Solace messaging services hosted inside your VMware Tanzu domain from external networks. By default, a VMware Tanzu-hosted service is not accessible to external networks.

<%= image_tag('arch_tcp_routes_newbranding.png') %>

Having TCP routes enables many use cases:

 * **Hybrid cloud:** Other Solace PubSub+ Event Brokers deployed outside VMware Tanzu can establish [Bridge](https://docs.solace.com/Features/Working-With-Message-VPN-Bridges.htm) connections to Solace PubSub+ services inside your VMware Tanzu cloud.
 * **External client app:** Apps deployed outside VMware Tanzu can communicate via messaging with apps deployed inside VMware Tanzu by connecting to a Solace PubSub+ service deployed in VMware Tanzu.
 * **IoT:** Devices using MQTT or REST can connect to Solace PubSub+ services from outside VMware Tanzu to communicate with your apps deployed inside VMware Tanzu, look for the *TCP Routes for IoT---MQTT Java Application Tutorial* [Getting Started Samples](http://dev.solace.com/get-started/pcf-tutorials/) with full source code available in [GitHub](https://github.com/SolaceSamples/solace-samples-cloudfoundry-java/tcp-routes-mqtt/).
 * **Mobile apps:** Mobile and web apps can use [web messaging](https://docs.solace.com/Features/Web-Messaging-Concepts/Web-Messaging-Concepts.htm) to connect to Solace PubSub+ services from outside VMware Tanzu to communicate with your apps deployed inside VMware Tanzu.

To use TCP routes, you must [enable and configure TCP Routes at installation time](installing.html#optional_tcp_routes) with a selection of default settings for each messaging protocol you wish to use. Once enabled, TCP routes can be fine-tuned per service at service creation time.

### <a id='pcf-solace-messaging-intergration-system_logging'></a> System Logging

System logging allows you to redirect the logs from the Solace PubSub+ VMware Tanzu components to an external syslog service. To use system logging, you must [enable and configure system logging at installation time](installing.html#optional_system_logging).

### <a id='pcf-solace-messaging-intergration-ldap'></a> LDAP

You can enable the use of an LDAP server for the Solace PubSub+ Event Broker's authentication and authorization needs. This configuration allows you to grant an LDAP server control over Management access and Application access. To use LDAP, you must [enable and configure LDAP at installation time](installing.html#optional_ldap_settings) and make a choice about [Management Access](installing.html#optional_management_access) and [Application Access](installing.html#optional_application_access).


## <a id='solace-messaging-features'></a> Solace PubSub+ Features

In addition to easy and natural APIs for your apps, Solace PubSub+ supports the following key features:

* [Easy integration with third-party products](https://docs.solace.com/Developer-Tools/Integration-Guides/Integration-Guides.htm) such as big data, ESBs, JEE, DataPower, and more.
* [Comprehensive authentication, authorization, and encryption](https://docs.solace.com/Overviews/Client-Authentication-Overview.htm) features to ensure that your infrastructure and information are protected at all times.
