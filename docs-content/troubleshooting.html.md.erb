title: Solace PubSub+ Troubleshooting 
owner: Partners
---

This topic describes how operators and developers can troubleshoot instances of Solace PubSub+ services.

A [Solace PubSub+ Service Instance](service-instances.html) is backed by a Message VPN on one or many Solace PubSub+ Software Message Broker, depending on the chosen plan.

You can discover the Solace PubSub+ Software Message Broker backing a service instance from the [Solace PubSub+ Credentials](credentials.html) which become available by [binding](bindings.html) an app to the instance or [creating a service key](service-keys.html) for the instance.


## <a id='operator'></a> Operator Troubleshooting

The operator will have access to the logs of all the components of Solace PubSub+ for VMware Tanzu:

* Service Broker Logs
* Service Broker Agent Logs
* Solace PubSub+ message broker Logs

An installation of Solace PubSub+ for VMware Tanzu may be configured to use [System Logging](installing.html#optional_system_logging) as a means of gathering all logs.

### <a id='operator_logs'></a> Accessing Logs 

The following locations in Solace PubSub+ BOSH VMs will hold logs of interest that can help in troubleshooting issues:

* All VM job logs
 * /var/vcap/sys/log
* All Solace PubSub+ message broker Logs
 * /var/vcap/store/containers/pubsub/volumes/jail/logs

The service broker logs are collected in the management VM under /var/vcap/sys/log/broker-logs.

When the Management app is deployed in High Availability mode, the service broker logs are captured on both the primary and backup VMS so it does not matter from which you get the logs.

This means that you can use the **bosh logs** command to download the service broker logs along with the other logs from the management VM.

You can also watch service broker logs as follows:

1. Set your API endpoint to the Cloud Controller of your deployment.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf api api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Setting api endpoint to api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN...
  OK
  API endpoint:  <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN (API version: 2.82.0)
  Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
  </pre>

1. Log in to your deployment and select an org and a space.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf login
  API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Email> user<span>@</span>example.com
  Password>
  </pre>

1. Target the `solace` org and `solace-broker` space.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf target -o solace -s solace-broker
	api endpoint:   https://api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
	api version:    2.82.0
	user:           admin
	org:            solace
	space:          solace-broker
	</pre>

1. Discover the Solace PubSub+ Service Broker App name.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf apps
	Getting apps in org solace /space solace-broker as user@example.com...
	OK

	name                              requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
	solace-broker-1.2.0            started           1/1         1G       512M   solace-broker.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN

	OK
	</pre>
	<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Take note of the application name. In this case 'solace-broker-1.2.0'</p>

1. To watch the logs of Solace PubSub+ Service Broker
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf logs solace-broker-1.2.0 | tee saved_solace-broker-1.2.0.txt
	Retrieving logs for app solace-broker-1.2.0 in org solace /space solace-broker as user@example.com...
	....
	</pre>

### <a id='operator_diag'></a> Additional Diagnostics

In addition to regular logging, Solace PubSub+ message brokers tools can help gather diagnostics logs on demand.

For example, having identified a problem with a given Solace service instance, the operator can access the backing Solace PubSub+ message brokers to examine logs and gather diagnostics.

The backing Solace PubSub+ message brokers for a given service instance can be identified from the IPs used in the bindings or service keys, or mentioned in the service broker logs or message when an exception occurs.

The operator should look for the VM in the Solace PubSub+ bosh deployment with the matching IP.

Get additional diagnostics from "EnterpriseLarge/0" VM.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ bosh ssh EnterpriseLarge/0
  # sudo -i
  # /var/vcap/jobs/broker\_agent/bin/gather\_diagnostics.sh
  </pre>
  Then you can look at the gathered logs under `/var/vcap/store/diag`.

In the event that a process fails and creates a core dump, the core file can be found under /var/vcap/store/cores. Core files are compressed using gzip.

### <a id='install_errors'></a> Installation Issues

If you get the error

<pre class="terminal">
Colocated job 'solace-bosh-dns-aliases' is already added to the instance group 'compute'
</pre>

then do the following:

- Log into your bosh environment
- Execute the command 'bosh configs'
- Look for runtime-configs with 'solace' in their name
- Delete the solace runtime-configs using the bosh 'delete-config' command
- Redeploy


### <a id='upgrade_errors'></a> Upgrade Issues

The following issues may arise while upgrading a tile:

<table border="1" class="nice">
<tr><th>Error</th>
<td>
<pre class="terminal">
Action Failed get_task: result: 1 of 1 drain scripts failed. Failed Jobs: containers.
</pre>
</td></tr>
<tr><th>Explanation</th><td>A pre-condition was not met. A high availability (HA) group was not in a healthy state at the start of the upgrade.
This check is done at the shutdown of each VM in an HA group.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Possible Action</th><td>Ensure an HA Group is healthy. The user can log into the failing VM and look at the log file located at /var/vcap/sys/log/containers/drain.stdout.log to determine the underlying cause.
Once an HA Group is healthy, an upgrade can be retried.
</td></tr>
</table>

<br>

<table border="1" class="nice">
<tr><th>Error</th>
<td>
<pre class="terminal">
Action Failed get_task: result: 1 of 1 post-start scripts failed. Failed Jobs: containers.
</pre>
</td></tr>
<tr><th>Explanation</th>
<td>
The upgrade was stopped due to a detected failure to ensure services remain available.
</td></tr>
<tr><th>Possible Action</th><td>The user should log into the failing VM and look at the log file located at /var/vcap/sys/log/containers/post-start.stdout.log to determine the underlying cause. Once the issue is fixed, an upgrade can be retried.</td></tr>
</table>

<br>

<table border="1" class="nice">
<tr><th>Error</th>
<td>
<pre class="terminal">
Process 'mariadb_ctrl' Execution failed
</pre>
</td></tr>
<tr><th>Explanation</th><td>Monit reports that MariaDB failed to start. This happens when using high availability management and 2 or more MariaDB processes are shutdown at the same time. The cluster has lost quorum and MariaDB processes can't restart automatically.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Possible Action</th><td>The MariaDB cluster needs to be bootstrapped. This is done by running the bootstrap errand with the command: bosh -d solace_deployment run-errand bootstrap. The bootstrap errand is always safe to run as it is a noop when it is not required. If the bootstrap errand does not fix the MariaDB process, the user should look at logs under /var/vcap/sys/log/mysql/.
</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For Shared service plans, every service on a broker must be marked for upgrade before the upgrade
 can happen. This prevents one tenant from upgrading a router before the other tenants are ready.
</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If some PubSub+ message brokers have been upgraded and others have not,
it is not possible to create new bindings or service keys with the non-upgraded services.
This is because features such as authentication schemes might have changed with the upgrade, and 
would not be compatible with the services created before the upgrade.
</p>

## <a id='developer'></a> Developer Troubleshooting

A developer using Solace PubSub+ for VMware Tanzu may encounter errors when using Cloud Foundry Command-Line Interface (cf CLI) to perform basic operations on a Solace PubSub+ for VMware Tanzu service instance.

In general, most errors are about these types:

 * Reaching limits (plan limits, inventory fully used)
 * Communication problems between the service broker and the VM inventory it manages
 * Unexpected health state, such as a degraded high availability setup

While this list it not complete, it provides representative samples with explanations and possible resolutions. Some of the resolutions will require operator intervention.
