This topic describes how developers can manage instances of Solace Messaging services.

##<a id='about_solace_service_instance'></a>About the Solace Service Instance

A Solace Service Instance represents a Message VPN on a Solace Virtual Message Router (VMR). A Message VPN allows for many separate apps to share a single message router while still remaining independent and separated. To learn more about Message VPNs, see [Core Concepts](https://docs.solace.com/Features/Core-Concepts.htm)

After deploying the Solace Messaging for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile, the Solace Messaging service appears in the Marketplace. Developers can use either the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) or Apps Manager to create an instance of the service which they can make available to apps that need to exchange messages.

By [binding](bindings.html) an app to the instance or [creating a service key](service-keys.html) for the instance, developers give the app permission to access this Message VPN through a client username or LDAP. For more information about how developers can use the credentials provided by the binding or service keys, see the [Understanding Solace Messaging Credentials](credentials.html) topic.

Creating a service instance also gives the developer permissions to manage the Message VPN through the SolAdmin administration tool. For more information, see the [Managing the Message VPN](managing.html) topic.

The following tutorials show you:

 * Using the cf Cli:
   * How to create a Solace Messaging service called *solace-messaging-instance* with no added service-specific parameters.
   * How to create a Solace Messaging service called *solace-messaging-instance-IoT* with added service-specific parameters.
   * How to update the service instance *solace-messaging-instance* with service-specific parameters.
   * How to delete a service instance.
 * Using Apps Manager
   * How to create a service instance.

While the provided tutorials are relevant to Solace Messaging, they do no provide a complete set of examples of how to manage service instances in Cloud Foundry.

##<a id='service-specific-configuration'></a>Service Specific Parameters

A service instance can be customized at creation time and updated as well using parameters when certain features are enabled.

1. When LDAP is enabled, these parameters can be used to control management access to a service instance.
 * ldapGroupAdminReadOnly: Admin ReadOnly permissions are granted to the provided value for that parameter.
 * ldapGroupAdminReadWrite: Admin ReadWrite permissions are granted to the provided value for that parameter.

1. When TCP Routes are enabled, and unless the configuration per procotol is "Not Allowed", you may use these parameters with valid values: `true`, `false` to control TCP Routes per service instance.
 * `tcp_route_enabled`
 * `smf_tcp_route_enabled`
 * `smf_tls_tcp_route_enabled`
 * `smf_zip_tcp_route_enabled`
 * `web_messaging_tcp_route_enabled`
 * `web_messaging_tls_tcp_route_enabled`
 * `mqtt_tcp_route_enabled`
 * `mqtt_tls_tcp_route_enabled`
 * `mqtt_ws_tcp_route_enabled`
 * `mqtt_wss_tcp_route_enabled`
 * `rest_tcp_route_enabled`
 * `rest_tls_tcp_route_enabled`

Service specific configuration parameters are a JSON object that is provided either in-line or in a file. To learn more about See [Arbitrary Parameters](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#arbitrary-params-create)


##<a id='cf-cli-create1'></a> Create a Service Instance with the cf CLI

To create an instance of the Solace Messaging service with the cf CLI, perform the following steps:

1. Set your API endpoint to the Cloud Controller of your deployment.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf api api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Setting api endpoint to api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN...
  OK
  API endpoint:  <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN (API version: 2.59.0)
  Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
  </pre>
1. Log in to your deployment and select an org and a space.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf login
  API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Email> user<span>@</span>example.com
  Password>
  </pre>
1. List the Marketplace services and locate the Solace Messaging service and its associated service plans.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf marketplace
	Getting services from marketplace in org example / space development as user<span>@</span>example.com...
	OK

	service          plans                                                description
	solace-messaging shared, large, community, medium-ha, large-ha        Solace Messaging for real-time, multi-protocol data distribution
	</pre>
1. Create an instance of the Solace Messaging service. Select the appropriate service plan for your app. See [PCF Marketplace Plans](index.html#marketplace-plans) for how the service plans differ. The following example uses the `large-ha` service plan and no service-specific parameters.

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf create-service solace-messaging large-ha solace-messaging-instance
	Creating service instance solace-messaging-instance in org example / space development as user@example.com...
	OK
	</pre>
	<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Any parameter dependent features will simply use their defaults. For example if you have TCP Routes enabled or LDAP enabled, all the selections made at tile installation time will be applicable to the created service as per tile configuration.</p>

1. Make this new service instance accessible to an app by [binding](bindings.html) or [creating a service key](service-keys.html).


##<a id='cf-cli-create2'></a> Create a Service Instance with the cf CLI having service-specific parameters

To create an instance of the Solace Messaging service with the cf CLI with service-specific parameters, perform the following steps:

1. Set your API endpoint to the Cloud Controller of your deployment.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf api api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Setting api endpoint to api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN...
  OK
  API endpoint:  <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN (API version: 2.59.0)
  Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
  </pre>
1. Log in to your deployment and select an org and a space.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf login
  API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Email> user<span>@</span>example.com
  Password>
  </pre>
1. List the Marketplace services and locate the Solace Messaging service and its associated service plans.
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf marketplace
	Getting services from marketplace in org example / space development as user<span>@</span>example.com...
	OK

	service          plans                                                description
	solace-messaging shared, large, community, medium-ha, large-ha        Solace Messaging for real-time, multi-protocol data distribution
	</pre>
1. Create an instance of the Solace Messaging service. Select the appropriate service plan for your app. See [PCF Marketplace Plans](index.html#marketplace-plans) for how the service plans differ. Add applicable service-specific parameters. The following example uses the `shared` service plan with service-specific parameters for TCP Routes that enable opening an MQTT TLS port to support IoT devices.

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf create-service solace-messaging shared solace-messaging-instance-IoT -c '{ "mqtt_tls_tcp_route_enabled" : "true" }'
	Creating service instance solace-messaging-instance-IoT in org example / space development as user@example.com...
	OK
	</pre>
1. Getting details about the created service.

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf service solace-messaging-instance-IoT

	Service instance: solace-messaging-instance-IoT
	Service: solace-messaging
	Bound apps:
	Tags:
	Plan: shared
	Description: Solace Messaging for real-time, multi-protocol data distribution
	Documentation url: http://docs.solace.com
	Dashboard:

	Started: 2020-01-01T00:00:00Z
	</pre>
1. Make this new service instance accessible to an app by [binding](bindings.html) or [creating a service key](service-keys.html).


##<a id='cf-cli-update'></a>Update a Service Instance with the cf CLI

Sometimes, you may wish to update an existing service instance to enable or disable a special feature. 
For example, you may want to close some TCP Routes port for a given protocol, let's say MQTT Plain Text port due to security concerns.
Or you may wish adjust LDAP Admin access.

To update an instance of the Solace Messaging service with the cf CLI, perform the following steps:

1. Set your API endpoint to the Cloud Controller of your deployment.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf api api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Setting api endpoint to api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN...
  OK
  API endpoint:  <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN (API version: 2.59.0)
  Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
  </pre>
1. Log in to your deployment and select an org and a space.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf login
  API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Email> user<span>@</span>example.com
  Password>
  </pre>
1. Locate the previously created service
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf services
	Getting services in org example / space dev as user<span>@</span>example.com...
	OK

	name                        service            plan     bound apps   last operation
	solace-messaging-instance   solace-messaging   large-ha              create succeeded
	</pre>

1. Update the service instance of the Solace Messaging service assuming both LDAP and TCP Routes are enabled.
This disables external access to the MQTT Plain Text messaging protocol, and grants Admin ReadOnly and Admin ReadWrite to the Message VPN for this service instance to the provided LDAP groups.


	<pre class="terminal">
        $ cf update-service solace-messaging-instance -c '{ "mqtt_tcp_route_enabled" : "false", "ldapGroupAdminReadOnly" : "cn=username1,ou=groups,dc=solace,dc=com", "ldapGroupAdminReadWrite" : "cn=username2,ou=groups,dc=solace,dc=com" }'
	Updating service instance solace-messaging-instance user...
	OK
	</pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Updating a Service Instance that has existing application bindings or service keys can be a service affecting operation. An existing app using bindings may need to unbind and rebind to obtain its updated Solace Messaging Credentials, an existing app using service keys will need to get a new service key.</p>

1. Make this new service instance accessible to an app by [binding](bindings.html) or [creating a service key](service-keys.html).

##<a id='cf-cli-delete'></a>Deleting a Service Instance with the cf CLI

A Service instance may be deleted once it has no bindings and no service keys.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Deleting a Service Instance is non recoverable, all data that was in the service instance will be lost.</p>

To delete an instance of the Solace Messaging service with the cf CLI, perform the following steps:

1. Set your API endpoint to the Cloud Controller of your deployment.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf api api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Setting api endpoint to api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN...
  OK
  API endpoint:  <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN (API version: 2.59.0)
  Not logged in. Use 'cf login' to log in.
  </pre>
1. Log in to your deployment and select an org and a space.
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ cf login
  API endpoint: <span>https:</span>//api.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN
  Email> user<span>@</span>example.com
  Password>
  </pre>
1. Locate the previously created service
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf services
	Getting services in org example / space dev as user<span>@</span>example.com...
	OK

	name                            service            plan     bound apps   last operation
	solace-messaging-instance-IoT   solace-messaging   shared                create succeeded
	</pre>

1. Delete the service instance "solace-messaging-instance-IoT" of the Solace Messaging service.


	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf delete-service solace-messaging-instance-IoT

	Really delete the service solace-messaging-instance-IoT?> yes
	Deleting service solace-messaging-instance-IoT in org example / space dev as user<span>@</span>example.com...
	OK

	Delete in progress. Use 'cf services' or 'cf service solace-messaging-instance-IoT' to check operation status.
	</pre>

1. You can monitor the progress of the delete operation.

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf services
	Getting services in org example / space dev as user<span>@</span>example.com...
	OK

	name                            service            plan     bound apps   last operation
	solace-messaging-instance-IoT   solace-messaging   shared                delete in progress
	</pre>

	Notice the 'delete in progress', this service will be removed once the deletion is completed.

	<pre class="terminal">
	$ cf services
	Getting services in org example / space dev as user<span>@</span>example.com...
	OK

	No services found
	</pre>
